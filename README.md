A compact, efficient, and automated smart charging trigger system built using an ATtiny 402 microcontroller, relays, and an IR sensor. This project automates the charging process with a custom-designed PCB.
Features
Automated Charging Trigger: Monitors charging conditions and activates relays as required.
IR Sensor Integration: Detects specific conditions to enable/disable the charging process.
Custom PCB Design: Compact and optimized for real-world applications.
Arduino-Based Programming: Simple, modular code for easy customization.
